# telegram_diceBot
Dice roll bot for Telegram

Supports standard dice notation.

Start with a Telegram bot token as first argument, for example:

coffee dicebot.coffee ABC123TOKEN



Note that I used a patched version of node-telegram-bot, which is why it is included in this repo and not added with NPM.
